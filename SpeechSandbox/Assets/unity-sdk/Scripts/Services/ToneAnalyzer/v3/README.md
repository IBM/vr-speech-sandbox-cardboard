# Tone Analyzer

The IBM Watsonâ„¢ [Tone Analyzer Service][tone-analyzer] uses linguistic analysis to detect three types of tones from written text: emotions, social tendencies, and writing style. Emotions identified include things like anger, fear, joy, sadness, and disgust. Identified social tendencies include things from the Big Five personality traits used by some psychologists. These include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional range. Identified writing styles include confident, analytical, and tentative.

## Usage

Emotions identified include things like anger, cheerfulness and sadness. Identified social tendencies include things from the Big Five personality traits used by some psychologists. These include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Identified language styles include things like confident, analytical, and tentative.

### Instantiating and authenticating the service
Before you can send requests to the service it must be instantiated and credentials must be set.
```cs
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Services.ToneAnalyzer.v1;
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Utilities;

void Start()
{
    Credentials credentials = new Credentials(<username>, <password>, <url>);
    ToneAnalyzer _toneAnalyzer = new ToneAnalyzer(credentials);
}
```


### Analyze tone
Analyzes the tone of a piece of text. The message is analyzed for several tones - social, emotional, and language. For each tone, various traits are derived. For example, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness.
```cs
private void AnalyzeTone()
{
    if (!_toneAnalyzer.GetToneAnalyze(OnGetToneAnalyze, OnFail, _stringToTestTone))
        Log.Debug("ExampleToneAnalyzer.GetToneAnalyze()", "Failed to analyze!");
}

private void OnGetToneAnalyze(ToneAnalyzerResponse resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleToneAnalyzer.OnGetToneAnalyze()", "Tone Analyzer - Analyze Response: {0}", customData["json"].ToString());
}

private void OnFail(RESTConnector.Error error, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Error("ExampleToneAnalyzer.OnFail()", "Error received: {0}", error.ToString());
}
```
